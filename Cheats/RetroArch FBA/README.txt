OK, so it seems like when you do Updates, you will have to do another Search each time.
So here are a few Notes for finding your own Cheats:

For Street Fighter Games
Health will ALWAYS have the following Values when Full
00900090

Address will generally have the Address location of 
08XXYYYY
XX - will mostly be the same
YYYY - will be close to other Address any prior Search before

sf2 Games will share the same Codes in each Core
sf2ce Games will also share the same Codes

sf2/sf2ce Inf Time Codes need to be Searched as Exact 8Bit Hex.
Value must only be Numbers. So 99 Seconds will be 99 Value.

sfa Series follows normal Hex Values. 99 Seconds is 63


There are some problems I have noticed.
For hsf2 and I think ssf2t, when I found the Inf HP and SP Codes, even though I
selected Turbo 0 in the System Config Menu or in the Free Selection, the Speed
seems to be faster. Also, it seems like no matter the Difficulty Setting, it
seems MUCH harder than it should be. Same for sfa and sfa2.
